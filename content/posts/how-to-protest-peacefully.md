## How to protest peacefully

Protests are a way for people to speak truth to power and drive social change by exposing injustice and abuse, demanding accountability, and inspiring hope for a better future. Throughout history, protests have been the driving force behind powerful social movements.

### Plan and prepare:

1.Have a clear goal:
Articulate your goals and the message you want to convey. A focused message can help keep the protest peaceful and prevent confusion or mixed signals.

2.Choose a suitable location:
Pick a public space that can accommodate your group and won't disrupt daily life or other events. Ensure you have the necessary permits, if required.

3.Designate roles:
Assign specific roles to individuals or small groups, such as leaders, legal observers, peacekeepers, and mediators. This helps maintain order and ensures quick responses to any issues.

4.Prepare for safety:
Establish hand signals or code words to communicate potential dangers or changes in plans. Decide on a meeting spot if people get separated.

### During the protest:

1.Stay calm and respectful:
Keep a calm tone and body language. Avoid engaging with counter-protesters or those who may incite violence. If someone becomes aggressive, de-escalate the situation by walking away or asking for help from peacekeepers.

2.Be mindful of your surroundings:
Pay attention to what's happening around you. If you notice potential dangers or signs of escalation, inform the designated leaders or peacekeepers. Keep an eye on exits in case you need to leave quickly.

3.Offer support:
Look out for each other. Bring water and offer it to those around you. Help those in need, and if you see someone being targeted or harassed, intervene PEACEFULLY or alert the appropriate people i.e press.

4.Engage peacefully:
Chant and sing: Use chants and songs to keep energy high and unity strong,This you honestly learn as you go.
Use art and symbols: Create signs, banners, and art that convey your message creatively and peacefully.

5.Observe and document:
If you're not comfortable with physical intervention, you can still be an ally by observing and documenting any incidents of police brutality or counter-protester aggression. Film interactions with officers and share your footage with trusted sources.

### After the protest:

1.Debrief and reflect:
Meet with your group to discuss what went well and what could be improved. This helps strengthen your strategies for future protests.

2.Follow up:
Share your experiences and any media coverage with those who couldn't attend. Continue the conversation and plan further actions if needed.
