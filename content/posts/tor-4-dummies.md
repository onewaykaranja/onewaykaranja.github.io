# TOR 

[Tor](https://www.torproject.org) is a privacy centred browser with the aim to bypass sensorship and making your browsing traffic private.

It works by routing your traffic through 3 different nodes(servers/computers) run by volunteers all over the world.This makes it hard for a tracking agent to really know what you are upto online.

An intresting fact about tor,is this is where you can access the infamous dark net.You can identify a dark net site with  .onion in their domain.Popular indexes are dark.fail & tor.taxi. You can read the darknet bible in the information section of [tor.taxi](tor.taxi).

Tor is a pretty easy browser to use,if you have used firefox it is pretty to navigate tor.Here is a list of the things i would do depending on what i'm on Tor for.

>1.Visit setting/Privacy and security and edit it as you please.Disabling javascript is probably the best bet for security especially if you are not visiting sites with  media,video or streams.  

> 2.Changing connection settings and using a bridge to hide your entry to Tor.This is targeted for areas where tor is blocked but if you are using a controlled network that getting to tor could raise alarms like school or work,use this!

These essensiality of the above points is very relative and might not be as important.

## Tor OPSEC rules.
OPSEC(operational security) DO NOT COMPROMISE  
> 1.Do not login to your clear net social media or email accounts.  
2.If you must use social media,do not use your real identity,create a disposable email and use that to get an otp to create a proxy account,or receive or send communication. 
  ~if just want to be in know use darknet alternatives like [(nitter.net)] for x 
3.If you are just a exploring there is absolutely no reason to access any of your real world accounts on tor.

>4.Double check links before clicking them.  
5.I wouldn't  download anything.  
6.Do not use your real identity or mention anything that could be tied to your real world identity.
These are honestly to prevent you from getting phished scammed or hijacked.  

This ofcourse doesn't make you 100% immune but since blog is for complete beginners ,you are good no one is out to get you anyways.


### Paranoid level
These is honestly a deep topic but i'll narrow it down to just on tor.Assuming every other opsec level is secure.

>1.No browser customersation.  
2.Verify every link before clicking it.  
  ~ It is best when you are sure of a link you save it offline and only get it from there.    
  3.Have a second persona; communication styles,intrests,values everything should be different from your real world.You will know how play this.  
4.Me personally i don't trust any tor node from the us,western europe,australia any country with relationships with your country is a no!  

Eliot said ```whoever controls the exit node controls the traffic ``` ,this is not sci-fi!
