## How to be safe during a protest

### 1.Research and plan ahead:

Before joining any protest, conduct thorough research to understand the organizers, their values, and their approach. Ensure that the protest aligns with your values and that the organizers prioritize nonviolence and have de-escalation strategies in place.
Identify the meeting location and time, and familiarize yourself with the area. Look for potential exit routes,first aid stations,safe havens that you can use if needed.

### 2. Strength in numbers:

Protesting with a group enhances your safety. Join or create a group of trusted individuals who share your values and goals. Stay together during the protest and look out for one another.

### 3.Protect your identity:

Consider covering your face with a mask, sunglasses, or other coverings to protect your identity, especially if you fear retaliation or targeting.

Digital privacy-if suspect you are targeted:

Limit your digital footprint by turning off location services and facial recognition on your devices. Avoid posting real-time updates on social media, as it can expose your location and the protest's dynamics to outsiders.

### 3.Bring essential items:

Pack a bag with essential supplies, including energy-rich snacks, plenty of water and extra masks.
Bring any essential medications you may need for a few days in case of an unexpected arrest.It could also help if you have hand written details of underlying conditions or your overall health biography as well as emergency contacts.

### 4.Stay vigilant and aware:

Always pay attention to your surroundings. Notice how people around you are behaving, and be mindful of potential counter-protesters or external agitators who might incite violence.
Follow the instructions of organizers and public officials, such as staying behind barricades or dispersing when instructed to do so.

### 5.De-escalation and disengagement:

If you encounter counter-protesters or agitators, avoid engaging with them. Stay calm, and do not respond to their provocations. Focus on the purpose of your protest and maintain a peaceful presence.


### 6.Know your rights and legal support:

Understand your legal rights as a protester, and know what to do if you are arrested. Have emergency contacts and legal support information readily available.

### 7.Exit strategy:

Identify a safe meeting place away from the protest site where you can gather with your group if you need to leave quickly.
