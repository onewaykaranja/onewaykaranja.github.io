## Hi there,


Three years ago if you would have asked me my opinion blogs,manuals and all the technical writings i dreaded them.I was the type to watch a tutorials instead. 

I can't speak for manuals but blogs do have their perks,subjective,they can be better than video tutorials especially if you struggle staying focused + it definately saves time.  

In the case my blogs are unbearable don't hesitate to chat me up on my socials below.
