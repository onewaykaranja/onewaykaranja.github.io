          How to protest peacefully # Protests are a way for people to speak truth to power and drive social change by exposing injustice and abuse, demanding accountability, and inspiring hope for a better future. Throughout history, protests have been the driving force behind powerful social movements. More on protests.
Plan and prepare: # 1.Have a clear goal: Articulate your goals and the message you want to convey. A focused message can help keep the protest peaceful and prevent confusion or mixed signals.

          How to be safe during a protest # 1.Research and plan ahead: # Before joining any protest, conduct thorough research to understand the organizers, their values, and their approach. Ensure that the protest aligns with your values and that the organizers prioritize nonviolence and have de-escalation strategies in place. Identify the meeting location and time, and familiarize yourself with the area. Look for potential exit routes,first aid stations,safe havens that you can use if needed.

          Logging # why logging?

Logs can help you identify problems with network connectivity,app behaviour and or system rules configurations.

          Hi there, # Three years ago if you would have asked me my opinion blogs,manualsðŸ˜¬, all the technical writings i dreaded them.I was the type to watch a tutorials instead.
I can&amp;rsquo;t speak for manuals but blogs do have their perks,subjective,they can be better than video tutorials especially if you struggle staying focused + it definately saves time.
In the case my blogs are unbearable don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to chat me up on my socials below.
